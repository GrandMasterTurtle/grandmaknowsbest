# Google Data Analytics Notes

## 5/22/2023

**People analytics:** is the practice of collecting and analyzing data on the people who make up a company's workforce to gain insights to improve how the company operates.

This allows for insights about employees and how they experience their work lives; this creates a robust, empowering, productive work environment.

### Six Steps:

- Ask
- Prepare
- Process
- Analyze
- Share
- Act

### Six Steps: Defined

1. **Ask** questions and define the problem.
2. **Prepare** data by collecting and storing the information.
3. **Process** data by cleaning and checking the information.
4. **Analyze** data to find patterns, relationships, and trends.
5. **Share** data with your audience.
6. **Act** on the data and use the analysis results.

Question: How can the organization improve the retention rate for new employees?

### Ask

The first part is to determine what the project will look like and what would qualify as a successful result.

Example:

- What do most new employees learn to succeed in their first job year?
- Have you gathered data from new employees before? If so, may we have access to the historical data?
- Do you believe managers with higher retention rates offer new employees something extra or unique?
- What do you suspect is a leading cause of dissatisfaction among new employees?
- By what percentage would you like employee retention to increase in the next fiscal year?

### Preparation

Prepare a timeline; in this case, it was three months and was given to interest parties, then identified the essential data needed to place in the last step. Using an online survey of new employees is where they determine to gather data.

- They developed specific questions about employee satisfaction with different business processes, such as hiring and onboarding, and their overall compensation.
- They established rules for who would have access to the data collected - in this case, anyone outside the group wouldn't have access to the raw data but could view summarized or aggregated data. So, for example, an individual's compensation wouldn't be available, but salary ranges for groups of individuals would be viewable.
- They finalized what specific information would be gathered and how to present it visually. Finally, the analysts brainstormed possible project- and data-related issues and how to avoid them.

### Process

The most important part of collecting data is ensuring that every employee understands how their data would be **************************************************************************************collected, stored, managed, and protected,************************************************************************************** and that they **************************************************************************************consent to participate.************************************************************************************** 

- They restricted access to the data to a limited number of analysts.
- They cleaned the data to ensure it was complete, correct, and relevant. Specific data was aggregated and summarized without revealing individual responses.
- They uploaded raw data to an internal data warehouse for an additional layer of security.

### Analyze

From the completed surveys, the data analysts **discovered** that an employee's experience with specific processes was a key indicator of overall job satisfaction.

- Employees who experienced a long and complicated hiring process would most likely leave the company.
- Employees who experienced an efficient and transparent evaluation and feedback process were most likely to remain with the company.

Most Important:

Regardless of the results, the group knew it was important to **document** exactly what they found in the analysis. To do otherwise would diminish trust in the survey process and reduce their ability to collect truthful data from employees in the future.

### Share

Making sure that the data was carefully protected in the last steps, another important part is to ensure that sharing the report is also careful.

- They shared the report with managers who met or exceeded the minimum number of direct reports with submitted responses to the survey.
- They presented the results to the managers to ensure they had the whole picture.
- They asked the managers to deliver the results to their teams personally.

Doing this allows the managers to **communicate the result** in the correct contexts, allowing for the creation of improvement and conversing with the production team to improve employee engagement.

### Act

The last stage for the analysts was to work with leaders within their company and decide how best to **implement changes and take action** based on the findings. These were their recommendations:

- Standardize the hiring and evaluation process for employees based on the most efficient and transparent practices.
- Conduct the same survey annually and compare results with the previous year's results.

A year later, the same survey was distributed to employees. Analysts anticipated that comparing the two sets of results would indicate that the action plan worked.

### **Summary**

The analysts **asked** questions to define both the issue to be solved and what would equal a successful result. 

Next, they **prepared** by building a timeline and collecting data with employee surveys designed to be inclusive.

They **processed** the data by cleaning it to make sure it was complete, correct, relevant, and free of errors and outliers. 

They **analyzed** the clean employee survey data. Then the analysts **shared** their findings and recommendations with team leaders. Afterward, leadership **acted** on the results and focused on improving key areas.

Key Data Analyst Tools

**Spreadsheets**

Google Sheets and Excel are two popular software.

Spreadsheets structure data in a meaningful way by letting you

- Collect, store, organize, and sort information.
- Identify patterns and piece the data together in a way that works for each specific data project.
- Create excellent data visualizations, like graphs and charts.

**Databases and Query Languages**

popular Structured Query Language (SQL) programs include MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and BigQuery.

- Allow analysts to isolate specific information from a database(s)
- Make it easier for you to learn and understand the requests made to databases
- Allow analysts to select, create, add, or download data from a database for analysis

**Visualization Tools**

- Turn complex numbers into a story that people can understand
- Help stakeholders come up with conclusions that lead to informed decisions and effective business strategies
- Have multiple features

- **Tableau**'s simple drag-and-drop feature lets users create interactive graphs in dashboards and worksheets

- **Looker** communicates directly with a database, allowing you to connect your data right to the visual tool you choose

Self-Reflection Question Answers:

- While the data analysis process will drive your projects and help you reach your business goals, you must understand the life cycle of your data to use that process. To analyze your data well, you need to understand it thoroughly. Similarly, you can collect all the data you want, but the data is only helpful to you if you have a plan for analyzing it.
- The Plan and Ask phases involve planning and asking questions but tackle different subjects. The Ask phase in the data analysis process focuses on big-picture strategic thinking about business goals. However, the Plan phase focuses on the fundamentals of the project, such as what data you have access to, what data you need, and where you’ll get it.
